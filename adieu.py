# This code is creating an empty list called `names` and then using a `while` loop with a `try` and
# `except` block to continuously prompt the user to input a name and append it to the `names` list
# until the user inputs an end-of-file (EOF) character (usually Ctrl+D on Unix-based systems or Ctrl+Z
# on Windows).

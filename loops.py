# This code is using a while loop to print the string "Hello world" three times. The variable

# is less than 3. Inside the loop, the string "Hello world" is printed and `number_of_time` is
# incremented by 1. This process repeats until `number_of_time` is equal to 3, at which point the loop
# terminates.
